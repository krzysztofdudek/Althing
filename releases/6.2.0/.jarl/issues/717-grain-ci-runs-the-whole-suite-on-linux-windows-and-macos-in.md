## What


## Why
Paths, links, signals and git behave differently on Windows and macOS; a suite run on Linux alone lets those faults through to users.

## Acceptance
- [read] .github/workflows/ci.yml runs the repository's whole test suite on ubuntu-latest, windows-latest (sharded where the suite is long) and macos-latest, Node 22 and 24, fail-fast off, as Jarl's does, and every step that ran on Linux alone now runs on all three or says in the workflow why it cannot
- [read] Every test that cannot run on a platform is skipped there with a stated reason, and the suite was run once locally on Linux with the platform guards in place; the first CI run on GitHub on all three platforms is green, recorded after the push
