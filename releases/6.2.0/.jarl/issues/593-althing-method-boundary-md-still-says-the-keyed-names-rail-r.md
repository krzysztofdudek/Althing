## What


## Why
After 363 the rail also scans another family repository's pushed range; the method page that describes the gate must say what it covers.

## Acceptance
[read] method/boundary.md says the names rail scans Althing's commits and, through ws names and the pre-push template, a family repository's pushed range, and links rails/README.md for how

  Minor (622; rails/git.mjs:217-237, rails/README.md:128): a forged signature armor carries a listed name past every scan (pre-push, CI and the nightly share the reader). Tried on the built tool through Althing's own pre-push: an OpenPGP armor with no checksum line, one packet of tag 2 whose length matches, its base64 spelling a test entry on a line of its own; a commit's gpgsig header with it arrived (range clean), and so did a tag whose message holds it in the middle, between prose lines, with a two-word entry written as Kelby/Fenn+A in base64 letters (the test list, not the real one); git shows that text as the tag's message. 'Proved' is a structural check, and the exclusion is wider than the README says: any armor in any header line, and anywhere in a tag's text, not only at its end. Only a deliberate forgery reaches it (no accidental path found), so a known limit: narrow the exclusion to where git writes a signature (the gpgsig and gpgsig-sha256 header, the trailing armor of a tag and of a mergetag) and name the forgery in the README's known limits. True SSH- and OpenPGP-signed commits and a signed tag pass clean. Judged on request: Althing's pre-push reads only the commits the pushed refs reach. This checkout sets no push refspec and no mirror; 916 commits are reached only by the local refs/t3 checkpoints and none from a branch, and a new-tag scan of main (648 commits) is clean, so the 290 history refusals cannot block a real push of a branch or tag. A push that carried those refs (--mirror, refs/t3/*) is read and refused by the path and English rails, as it must be. No names refusal is hidden: each prints on its own line, and the nightly runs on a fresh CI clone without those refs. Every leak of the 363 rounds re-run through Althing's own hooks with real commits and pushes to a local bare remote, each refused at the right place with nothing arrived: quoted paths (space, Polish letter, quotes), lines after '++ ' and '+++ b/', merge resolutions that remove a line or join two, a merge adding a file, a split name, author e-mail, committer name, extra header, mergetag, tag message, tagger, tag name, a tag of a tag, raw ISO-8859-2 commit and tag, ISO-8859-2 under an encoding header, an unknown encoding, a replacement object, a graft file (exit 2); a comment-only graft file and true signatures pass. Red before green reproduced for 592/609/616 (11 of 13 fail at df39a35), 622 (3 of 54 at 481812c), 603 (2 of 15 at 83df69c) and 613 (3 of 17 at 3ee9975, failing on git -C <dir> push, not on a missing module). 593 [read] met: method/boundary.md says the names rail 'also reads the pushed range of another family repository, on the maintainer's machine: node workspace/ws.mjs names runs it over a range of that repository's checkout, and the pre-push hook template a tool repository installs (workspace/hooks/pre-push) runs it before a push leaves. The rails' README says what each scan reads and how'. No test, rail or hook weakened; the rule change carries the owner's ratification (code-read-only-to-tools-v2-ratified); rails/english.mjs keeps its old check under english-rule-link-fault-stays.
  outside the issue, filed as 657: Althing's pre-commit leaves out a staged file whose type changed (rails/git.mjs:278 filters ACMR, so a link turned into a file is not read, though line 284 treats a type change as handled): a link replaced by a note holding a test entry passed pre-commit with the key; the pre-push refused it. The filter predates this change.
  outside the issue, filed as 658: A new tag or branch pushed to Althing reads the whole history of the pushed commit (rails/run.mjs:230): measured on this machine, 648 commits of main in 991 s with a test key, clean. Not a leak, but a latent hard block: once any public commit trips a rule added or tightened later (a name put on the deny-list after it went public, which is the leak response's own case, or a stricter English or path rule), every new tag or branch push to Althing is refused, with no way out but rewriting public history or bypassing the hook. Asking the remote what it holds, as rails/names-range.mjs remoteHolds already does, removes both the wait and the block; the nightly CI history scan still reads the whole history. Same root as w-592-fable's outside note 2 on 592: file once.
