# 316 · Jarl: CLAUDE.md points to Althing and the README's family section gains the Althing sentence (the docs half of 269, after Althing's first push)

**Status:** in-progress

## What
Split from 269 under the ruling jarl-release-alone-with-every-jarl-issue: 269 keeps the real-loop test, which goes into Jarl 6.2.0, and this issue holds its docs half, which waits on Althing's first push (266) by its own terms, because a public pointer to an unpushed repository points nowhere (scope review of 2026-10-18, Q7). The move's step M9 for Jarl: CLAUDE.md gains the line 'Issues, releases, research and the family canon live in Althing: https://github.com/krzysztofdudek/Althing'. README.md's family section takes the canon's block as it stands in Althing's family/canon.md, which ends with 'The family is developed in the open in Althing: its releases, research and rulings.' (ruling ask-014: after Althing's first push). On the first JarlSkill release branch cut after 266, in a worker worktree, never in the driver checkout, whose branch stays put for the whole release (jarl-pinned-in-loop). Pushed only on the owner's word.

## Why
An agent working in the repository finds where its issues, releases and rulings are decided only through that pointer, and the canon's drift check (ws check canon-sync) reports the README as drifting until it carries the canon's block as it stands.

## Acceptance
- From Althing, node workspace/ws.mjs check canon-sync --source local --ref jarl=<the branch carrying the change> reports no difference for Jarl, and CLAUDE.md carries the pointer line
- cd skills/jarl/scripts && npm test is green on the commit

  Important (545): skills/jarl/scripts/jarl.mjs:87 refuses round --findings in a patch release. Jarl 6.3.0 documents --findings <n>, and the MCP tool jarl_round refuses the field findings too (tried: refused, naming finding-count). Any 6.3.0 caller, script or MCP client that counts findings breaks on 6.3.1. The CHANGELOG lists the rename under Unreleased with no Before you upgrade note, and the family's own policy keeps changes that ask something of a caller for a minor release. Keep --findings working as an alias that prints a notice naming --finding-count, on the command line and in the MCP tool, and test that the alias records the same count.
  Important (542): the new closing-block line **Supersession withdrawn:** (skills/jarl/scripts/lib/questions.mjs:402, read at lib/journal.mjs:213) is silently misread by Jarl 6.3.0, the version of the installed MCP plugin while this loop runs, and the record format stays 4. A 6.3.0 reader parses the closing block from its end, stops at the unknown line, and pulls By, Applies to, Superseded by and the owner's words into the ruling's text. Tried on a copy of the 6.2.0 record: after decide probe-d --supersedes yggdrasil-no-provider-redaction and retract yggdrasil-no-provider-redaction supersession, 6.3.0 reads that owner's ruling with by null and quote null. After a supersession of the rule try-to-break-a-guard was withdrawn, 6.3.0 reads appliesTo null, and its reviewer brief no longer carries the rule (6.3.1's does). references/record.md:47 explains what an older reader does with Applies to, but not with this line. Either write the withdrawal in a shape a 6.3.0 reader still parses, or say in the changelog (Before you upgrade) and in record.md that every reader must be 6.3.1 before a supersession is withdrawn. Test it with the 6.3.0 reader's parse of a record that holds the line.
  Minor (543): the heuristic at skills/jarl/scripts/lib/rules.mjs:220 reads an obligation word anywhere in the text, including the owner's words quoted inline and descriptions of product behaviour. On the real 6.2.0 record it would note 67 of the 175 rulings that carry no Applies to (55 besides the ask-<n> answers). By my reading, about 12 to 15 of those 55 are instructions to agents (fixes-on-word, finish-open-work, no-fable-model, hard-work-on-opus, avoid-fable and the like). The rest are records such as 340-line-2-reads-too-large-only (is never decoded), backlog-tidy-for-the-three-tools (1.0.1 was never published) and 566-line-1-red-before-per-extractor (must stay green). Of the last 40 rulings, 9 would be noted and about 4 rightly. The note says that a record needs nothing, so the cost is one stderr line, but most of the notes are false.
  Minor (544): skills/jarl/scripts/lib/rounds.mjs:423 skips only .git and node_modules. A lease whose branch is checked out in the checkout that holds the loop (Branch: main on an Althing issue, as 1 of 62 Althing issues here was) is never idle while anyone writes the loop. Tried on a copy, with the lease's log line, Since and every file backdated three hours: one unrelated log write brought lastWork back to 0 minutes. Leaving the loop's own .jarl directory out of the scan would close this.
  Minor (542): a refusal of a --supersedes list that holds one bad slug prints a form in which every slug given, the valid ones too, is replaced by a placeholder.
  What holds: each of the 8 new test files was red on b6d808c for its own reason (the assertion of its change, not a missing export) and is green on 79fcc23. The full suite on 79fcc23: tests 1855, pass 1833, fail 0, skipped 22, exit 0. On a copy of the real record: 466 (Repo ../../../Yggdrasil) and 679 (Repo Yggdrasil) leased in one set call brief as one lease, and the base refuses them. The repo selectors Yggdrasil, ../../../Yggdrasil, yggdrasil, a trailing slash, an absolute path, Gard and Mimir are accepted and reach both spellings; Nothing and ./repo are refused. --supersedes is all or none against an already superseded slug and against an unknown one, and live counts moved 177, 177, 176. retract supersession puts the ruling back in force, logs who and why, and refuses a second withdrawal, a missing --by and an empty reason; a new supersession after it works. decisions --live --as reviewer lists 8 rules, and painter is refused. Delivered rules carry no Made under or owner's-words lines. Retracting a note that carries the owner's words works, and a reason holding the marker is refused. 316: ws check canon-sync --ref jarl=jarl/540-jarl-6-3-1 reports no difference for Jarl, and CLAUDE.md:9 carries the pointer. The record contract is unchanged (RECORD_API jarl-record/4, record-contract.test.mjs untouched, record.mjs only a comment). The worktree scan takes under 0.1s on a 7630-file worktree. Platforms: ci.yml runs Linux, Windows (3 shards) and macOS on Node 22 and 24. The diff adds nothing Linux-only (path.join, lstat and Dirent types, no symlink following), but I could not run Windows or macOS. Changed tests were reworded only to keep the old note from firing, with no assertion weakened.

## Evidence

### Notes

The README's family section already carried the canon's block with the Althing sentence on main, and the canon check reports no difference for Jarl on this branch (it reports two, for Yggdrasil and Grain); only the pointer in CLAUDE.md was missing, and it is added. The two lines are [read] lines and take no row.
