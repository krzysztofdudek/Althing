## What
A new tag or branch pushed to Althing reads the whole history of the pushed commit (rails/run.mjs:230): measured on this machine, 648 commits of main in 991 s with a test key, clean. Not a leak, but a latent hard block: once any public commit trips a rule added or tightened later (a name put on the deny-list after it went public, which is the leak response's own case, or a stricter English or path rule), every new tag or branch push to Althing is refused, with no way out but rewriting public history or bypassing the hook. Asking the remote what it holds, as rails/names-range.mjs remoteHolds already does, removes both the wait and the block; the nightly CI history scan still reads the whole history. Same root as w-592-fable's outside note 2 on 592: file once.
